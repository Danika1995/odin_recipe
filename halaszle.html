        <p>This hearty fish soup was originally prepared by fishermen along the banks of the Danube and Tisza Rivers, but has since become one of the most popular Christmas Eve dishes in Hungary.
        </p>
        <article>A number of versions exist, some are served over pasta, others include cream, but all are made using freshwater fish such as carp, perch or pike. Fried fish are also served at the festive dinner, along with warm potato salad. To complete the feast, beloved Hungarian desserts are offered, such as beigli (walnut and poppyseed roll), kifli (crescent-shaped yeast roll), and chocolate-coated fondant candies called szaloncukor, which are hung on the Christmas tree and used to decorate yuletide gifts.</article>
