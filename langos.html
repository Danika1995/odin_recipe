        <p>Lángos is a classic Hungarian fried bread, sold everywhere by street carts and vendors. It can be topped with a variety of ingredients but is usually eaten as is. Fluffy and light, this favorite fair food is made from yeasted dough and often with additional mashed potatoes to make krumplis lángos (potato lángos).</p>

                <h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
                <li>1 cup freshly mashed and warm russet potato, from about 1 medium potato</li>
                <li>2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast (rapid-rise or bread machine yeast)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
                <li>1 3/4 cups (240 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
                <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
                <li>Canola oil, for frying</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, halved
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <h3><u>Instructions</u></h3>
                <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                <li>Place the freshly mashed warm potato alongside the yeast, sugar, flour, oil, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and milk in a big mixing bowl or stand mixer.</li>
                <li>Using the paddle attachment, combine the ingredients until they are well moistened. If mixing by hand, start the process by mixing with a wooden spoon.</li>
                <li>Switch to the dough hook and knead for 5 to 7 minutes or until smooth and elastic. If mixing by hand, give yourself an extra 5 minutes of working the dough, until it's smooth and not sticking to your hands.</li>
                <li>Transfer the dough to a greased bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled in size, approximately 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Divide dough into 4 equal portions. Shape each piece into a smooth ball and place it on a lightly floured board. Cover and let rest another 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet, heat an inch of canola oil to 350 F.</li>
                <li>Flatten and stretch each dough ball to a disc 8 inches in diameter. Make 1 or more slits in the center of the stretched dough with a sharp knife. The slits are traditional but also keep the dough from puffing up in the middle.</li>
                <li>Fry one lángos at a time for about 2 minutes per side or until golden. Drain on paper towels. Serve hot, rubbed with a cut garlic clove and sprinkled with salt to taste.</li>
